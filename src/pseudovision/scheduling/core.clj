  "Playout build engine.

   Entry points:
     (build! db opts playout)   — full rebuild from scratch
     (rebuild! db opts playout) — incremental: extend the timeline forward

   The engine walks the schedule's slots in order, advancing a cursor
   through the content collections and emitting playout_events rows.

   Slot fill modes:
     :once  — emit one item then advance to next slot
     :count — emit exactly N items then advance
     :block — fill a fixed duration, pad tail with filler, then advance
     :flood — fill until the next fixed-anchor slot, then advance

   Slot anchors:
     :fixed      — slot starts at a specific wall-clock time of day
     :sequential — slot starts immediately when the previous one ends"
