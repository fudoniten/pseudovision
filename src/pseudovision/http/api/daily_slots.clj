   the canonical `genre:` rows in `metadata_tags` (e.g. `genre:mystery`,
   `genre:sci-fi-and-fantasy`). All categorisation lives in `metadata_tags`
   alongside `channel:<slug>`, `time-slot:*`, `audience:*`, and the other
   dimensions; the legacy `metadata_genres` table is gone.

   Matches are case-insensitive on tags (Postgres `lower(t.name)`) so the
   legacy \"Mystery\" form matches the canonical \"mystery\" storage, AND
   we also try the kebab-cased form so LLM-generated overrides like
   `random:Sci-Fi & Fantasy` (with `&` and spaces) hit the canonical
   `genre:sci-fi-and-fantasy` tag.

   Matching shows are expanded to their (season-nested) episodes and matching
   movies resolve to themselves, so the returned rows are always directly
   playable items, never bare show rows.

   Each row carries a `:_top-id` key holding the id of the top-level item it
   was resolved from (the show for episode rows, the movie for movie rows —
   identical in that case). Downstream `category_filters` matching uses this

  "Creates a playout_event map from a DailySlot.

   Two things used to make this unsafe for content that doesn't divide evenly
   into its slot (almost every movie in a 1-hour `random:movie` slot):

     1. `finish_at` was stamped from the slot's own `end_time`, not the picked
        item's actual runtime — a 2h movie in a 1h slot was recorded as if it
        finished on time, so the next slot's event started on top of it.
     2. Item selection ignored the slot's duration entirely.

   `pick-item` now narrows `random:<category>` pools to runtime-appropriate
   candidates (see `select-fitting-items`), and this function stamps the
   event with the item's REAL duration. `cursor` is the actual instant the
   previous slot in this batch finished at (nil for the first slot): when the
   previous item overran its slot, this slot's start shifts forward to begin
   right after it — no overlap, at the cost of occasionally starting a few
   minutes late. When the previous item finished at or before this slot's own
   nominal start (including a genuine gap, e.g. a day boundary), this slot
   starts at its own nominal time and any drift settles back to zero.
